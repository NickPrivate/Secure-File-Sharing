## This Project Aims to teach:
- Low level sockets programming in Python
  - Both the indexing server and Peer-to-Peer file transfer 
- Common cryptographic principles
  - Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)
  - Symmetric Encryption (AES)
  - Digital Signature (RSA/DSA)
- Concurrent Server and Relational Database (SQLite && Threading)
  - Connection with secure TCP sockets
  - Custom file keyword queries
  - Efficient custom SQL queries
- Secure Key Distribution and Encrypted File Transfer
  - Key distribution done with encrypting AES and nonce using RSA
  - File encryption done with AES
  - File transfer done with custom socket protocols
