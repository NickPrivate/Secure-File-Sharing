## Project Overview

### Low-Level Sockets Programming
This project involves both the indexing server and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file transfer using Python sockets. The implementation covers:
- Establishing TCP connections
- Handling multiple connections concurrently using threading
- Custom protocols for file transfer and communication

### Cryptographic Principles
The project incorporates several cryptographic techniques to ensure secure file transfer:
- **Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)**: Used for encrypting the AES key and verifying digital signatures.
- **Symmetric Encryption (AES)**: Used for encrypting the file contents.
- **Digital Signature (RSA/DSA)**: Used for verifying the integrity and authenticity of the transferred files.

### Concurrent Server and Database
The indexing server is designed to handle multiple peer connections simultaneously. It uses:
- **SQLite** for managing file metadata and user information.
- **Threading** for handling concurrent connections and database operations.

### Secure Key Distribution and Encrypted File Transfer
The project implements a secure key distribution mechanism and encrypted file transfer protocol:
- **Key Distribution**: AES key and nonce are encrypted with the receiver's RSA public key.
- **File Encryption**: The file is encrypted using AES.
- **File Transfer**: Custom socket protocols are used for transmitting the encrypted file and keys.

## Security Protocols

### Key Distribution
1. **Initial Key Exchange**:
   - Sender and receiver exchange their public RSA/DSA keys.
2. **AES Key Generation**:
   - The sender generates an AES key and a nonce.
3. **Encryption of AES Key**:
   - The AES key and nonce are encrypted using the receiver's public RSA key.
4. **Transmission**:
   - The encrypted AES key and nonce are sent to the receiver.
5. **Decryption**:
   - The receiver decrypts the AES key and nonce using their private RSA key.

### File Encryption and Integrity Verification
1. **File Encryption**:
   - The file is encrypted using the AES key and nonce.
2. **Digital Signature**:
   - The sender generates an RSA/DSA signature for the encrypted file.
3. **Transmission**:
   - The encrypted file and signature are sent to the receiver.
4. **Decryption**:
   - The receiver decrypts the file using the AES key.
5. **Integrity Verification**:
   - The receiver verifies the file's integrity using the RSA/DSA signature. If verification fails, the download is canceled; if it succeeds, the file is downloaded.

## Usage

1. **Start the Indexing Server**:
   - Navigate to the `Server` directory and run `server.py`
   ```bash
   cd src/Server
   python server.py
2. **Start User 1 (sender)**:
   - Navigate to `user1` inside the `test` directory and run `client.py`
   ```bash
   cd test/user1
   python client.py
3. **Start User 2 (receiver)**:
   - Navigate to `user2` inside the `test` directory and run `client.py`
   ```bash
   cd test/user2
   python client.py
